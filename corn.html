                    a creamy sweet corn soup made from fresh American sweet corn.
                    To make this sweet corn soup with half-half of milk and water.
                     The milk would also contribute to the sweetness in the soup.
                      In the recipe post, I have used water. I never have vegetable stock ready at home.
                      Sometimes I add spring onions to the soup.grated or finely chopped veggies can also be added.
                      Use freshly ground pepper as the aroma from freshly ground or crushed pepper 
                      adds a lot of depth to this simple sweet corn soup

                masala corn is a favorite with kids and most of us.
                 You can always add your choice of spices or add less or more and make a lot of variations in the recipe.
                 Steam or pressure cook 1 medium to large corn cob. You can steam 1 medium to large sweet
                  corn cob in a steamer or a pressure cooker. If pressure cooking, then pressure cook for 2 to 3 whistles 
                  in 1.5 cups water. 
                 You can also use 1 cup of tinned corn kernels.
                 Mix the melted butter very well with the corn kernels. Alternatively, 
                 you can melt the butter and add to the corn kernels.
                 Now add all the seasonings – ½ teaspoon chilli powder, ½ teaspoon chaat masala, ¼ teaspoon dried oregano, 2 to 3 teaspoons of chopped coriander leaves. You can also add your choice of dried herbs
